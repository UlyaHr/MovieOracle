                      <p>This movie didn't make much of a splash when it was released, but its popularity has only increased over time. The film stars Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as rival magicians whose feud turns deadly as they continue trying to outdo the other in search of the perfect trick.<br><br>Once again, Nolan created a story that had audiences on the edge of their seats until the credit rolled. The dark tone of the film kept you engaged as the strange story slowly revealed itself in clever and mind-blowing ways.</p>

                      <p>In an alternate 1985, superheroes and costumed vigilantes exist. They formed the Minutemen in 1940 but the . Nixon is the president and the world is on the brink of nuclear war. It's a dark ambitious world that Zack Snyder and friends have created. It may be too ambitious but they really gave it their all. It's got a great style. Some may complain about changes from the graphic novel. That's always a failed argument for me.<br><br>Malin Akerman does a good job despite the naysayers. Dr. Manhattan digs into some existential questions. I like everybody especially Jackie Earle Haley's performance. There are many great aspects that they easily smooth out any bumps in the road.</p>

                      <p>It's WWII and Germany is losing the war. 10 year old Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) can't tie his own shoes and has an imaginary friend in Hitler (Taika Waititi). He is starting Hitler youth training under weary war veteran Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell). He refuses to kill a rabbit and the guys ridicule him as Jojo Rabbit. One day, he finds a girl living in the wall of his late sister's room. His mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding Jewish girl Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie).<br><br>This is an inventive film. It is feel-good and heart-breaking. It has comedy and tragedy. It is an outside-the-box, brilliant film from the unusual Taika Waititi. The kid is brilliant. The best friend is funny. ScarJo is terrific. There are some big-time emotional gut punches. There are surprising turns. This is one of the year's best.</p>
